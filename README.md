## Objective

To build a chatbot employing ML/DL techniques that can determine the accident level &
potential level involved in any accident based on the text description.

## Problem Statement & Abstract

With the advancement of technology, manual labour requirement in industries has reduced
considerably. However, itâ€™s still a long way before industries achieve 100% automation.
Since human activity is involved, accidents & injuries are common despite all the safety
measures and precautions put in place. Such injuries can also prove fatal. Industrial
accidents can turn depending on the type of industry. For example, a mere spark in a
firecracker factory can burn the whole plant leading to loss of lives and property.
Workplace injuries are a big concern for both workers and management. It is imperative to
classify industrial incidents into different categories and determine whether the event was
merely an accident, due to negligence or by incompetence. This avoids reoccurrences,
reduce frequency of occurrence & severity and minimize the effects.
To achieve this we employ exploratory data analysis on a dataset from one of the biggest
Brazilian industries and find out the top reasons for industrial accidents, nature of accidents,
type of employees being injured and so on. We also aim to develop a chatbot application
using natural language processing to classify the accident into various critical risks by looking
at the description of the accident.
